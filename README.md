# Mothmam

Convert HTML code to simple simple Word documents.

## Overview

This library is intended to be the inverse (so to speak) of the wonderful
[Mammoth.js](https://github.com/mwilliamson/mammoth.js) library. Whereas Mammoth
converts Word files into simple HTML, this library converts HTML into simple Word
files.
